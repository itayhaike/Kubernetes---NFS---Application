# Kubernetes---NFS---Application

Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that enables a computer to access files over a network as if they were stored locally. It is used to share files between computers and centralize data storage.

By using NFT with K8S we can deploy our application on different environments that will communicate with each other.

For example, we can create 3 nodes on our cluster, the 1st is the master 2nd will be the application and the 3rd will be the database,
All three of these nodes will communicate and transmit information using NFT.
